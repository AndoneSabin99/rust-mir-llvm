# rust-mir-llvm (Work in progress...)


This repository has been created with the intention to be used a as a support for my internship (and thesis) project "Secure Compilation from Rust to MSWasm". It includes Rust source code along with its Intermediate Representations (IR) in both MIR and LLVM IR formats. 
Future updates will be added gradually."
